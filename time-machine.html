        <p>The long literary tradition of the utopian genre, in which authors fantasize about better societies or <b>utopias</b> (from Greek u or ou, no, not; topos, place) found its realization in a the political trend of utopianism or social dreaming. Various schools of utopianists, be it early socialists of the 19th century or the first adepts of cybernetic utopia of the 1950-s, dreamt differently and sometimes even oppositionally. However, every utopian dream shares certain common elements, including well articulated dress codes represented by <b>utopian</b> dress that support and reaffirm the values promoted by utopian ideologists.</p>

        <p>Members of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood objected to the highly structured and heavily trimmed silhouettes so common for Victorian fashion. They wanted to see the beauty of a body and its natural curves. The wives and lovers of pre-raphaelite painters started to wear soft-silhouetted  dresses, romanticizing medieval aesthetics. This bohemian, anti-fashion style became known as ‘artistic dress’ and was quite popular for a decade in artistic circles.</p>

        <p>Avant garde artists of early 20th century were developing impressive techno utopian imagery, a part of which was a new type of dress that could help merge the human body with machines to achieve a perfect human. Fashion was seen as one of the vehicles in the quest for egalitarianism and socialism. Thus, the initial political impulse of socialists met radical technological fantasies of the industrial era to shape a new branch of utopian dress that would later evolve into what is known today as wearable technology. </p>

        <p>Dress reformer and psychoanalyst J.C.Flugel published his  work The psychology of clothes where he argued that clothes should serve to express democratic values. Flugel rejected futile pursuits of the latest trends. Instead he proposed a vision of a collectivist utopia where people would rather go naked and enjoy the natural beauty of their bodies. The ideas of Flugel should not seem too bizarre, as the time when he was creating his seminal works was marked by a significant interest in eugenics and amusement with a body as the object of scientific development.</p>

        <p>Some authors even went further to create literary utopias where people would not need any clothes at all. If in Flugel’s opinion inhabitants of a happy and just society could go around naked, H. G. Wells and Gerald Heard imagined worlds where people eventually would have no body, thus fashion would become useless. Authors of scientific utopias of the 1930’s were precursors to the ideologists of transhumanism in the late 20 century, who also postulate a human body as an object of perpetual improvement in the quest of perfection that can be achieved with the help of plastic surgery or digital gadgets that blur the boundaries between human and machine.</p>

        <p>After the 1950’s utopian dress gradually started to lose its actual political functions. Nevertheless, the fashion industry instantly appropriated both the techno utopian and communitarian aesthetics of utopian dress  to reproduce them both as high fashion ‘utility chic’ minimalist clothing, and as wearable technology items produced by marginal fashion companies as well as by techno giants such as Phillips.</p>

        <p>The works of Lucy Orta exist on the cross section of contemporary art and fashion. They can be perceived as political statements that remind us how aggressive city environments can be. Dress can serve as a protection shield against the aggressive nature of urban environments. They also demonstrate human interdependence and the necessity to care about the person next to oneself.  Thus, Orta’s works bring us back to the initial ideas of the early socialists who also saw dress as a tool of human interaction.</p>

        <p>While the phenomenon of utopian dress has been almost completely forgotten, a number of emerging designers actively work with the aesthetics of utilitarian and gender neutral dress, Thus reinventing the idea of rational dress, devoid of any excessive decoration. The key conceptual element of this type of clothing are austerity and neutrality is juxtaposed to flashy colours and an abundance of logos and patterns so common to the visual culture of digital era. These gender neutral designs also correspond to popular ideas within post-humanism that promote the image of a human being with a fluid identity and  blurred gender/age/status markers.</p>
